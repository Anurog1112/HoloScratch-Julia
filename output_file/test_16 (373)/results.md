=== step 1: Setup & Load ===
Resolution: 3840 x 2160 pixels
Bit Depth:  Converted to 64-bit Float for processing

=== step 2: FFT & Spectral Analysis ===
Found Sideband Peak at: x=1857 y=1102

=== step 3: ASM Propagation ===

--- Auto-Focus Sweep ---
Coarse best z = 5.0 cm
Fine   best z = 4.0 cm  (score=0.13228)
Using z = 4.0 cm for reconstruction
Applying Gaussian smoothing (σ=6.0)...

=== Step 4 & 5: Unwrap & Scaling ===
Unwrapping Phase (Simple 2D)...
Applying Plane Subtraction (Tilt Removal)...
Applying Median Filter (11×11) on height map...

Focused at z = 4.0 cm
Max Height/Depth: 1307.2191976471186 nm
Min Height/Depth: -1248.482350323894 nm
